#  News: to package distrMod 
######################################################################

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + after JMC's changes: gone through setIs relations to ensure 
       "correct" inheritance
  * moved license to LGPL-3
  * new plot()-methods capabilities comparable to those of plot()-methods
    in package distr(): 
     + plot-L2ParamFamily now also digests ... , in particular panel.first=grid()
  * corrected some buglets:
     + corrected small bug in SimpleL2ParamFamilies.R ...
     + corrected small bug in GumbelLocationFamily ...
     + small modifications to modifyModel.R 
       ... modification of model a crucial step ... find a better way to do this???
  * new show() for 'confint'
  * new 'confint' methods for robust confidence intervals 

##############
v 2.0 
##############

* start of the package
* includes Parametric Models (with corresponding S4 classes)
* parameter (realized as corresponding S4 class) is split up into  
    +main part
    +nuisance part
    +fixed part
  may be transformed by user defined trafo function
* includes Minimum Criterium Estimators (with corresponding S4 classes)
   ---with particular cases 
   +Maximum Likelihood
   +Minimum Distance Estimators for 
    Kolmogorov, Hellinger, Totalvariation, and Cramer von Mises distance
* Minimum Criterum Estimators can (but do not need to) use method dispatch;
  this way particular methods beyond numerical optimization can be used
  without changing distrMod code
* has Symmetry classes (useful for avoiding unnecessary integrations)
* has biastype classes
* has norm classes (to be used for differently standardized risks and ICs)
* includes confint() methods for our Estimator classes
* features risk classes (mainly used in RobASt packages, though)
* includes demos/scripts
