##############
v 2.1
##############

 * Rd-style:
   + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
     cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
        [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,

 * MODELS
   + added mad.const to guarantee for mad-consistency in location scale model
   + loc/scale model: standardization by n not by (n-1) as in case of sd .
   + minor modification, L2derivDistr in case of location and scale families
   + some modifications such that LnormScaleFamily works properly ...
   + bug in  LnormScaleFamily corrected ...
   + modifyModel gains argument .withL2derivDistr --- 
       if false needs not be calculated (as e.g. this is done in a particular 
       method calling the general method first...)

 * TRAFO
   + fixed some inconsistencies with slot trafo:
     now when trafo is a function, we try to keep it as a function under
     moves of the parametric model...
   + we introduce
     - a function trafo.fct() (see ?trafo.fct)
       to access the "function" aspect of trafo
     - a function trafoEst() which transforms an existing estimator of class "estimate"
       consistently (i.e. with corresponding untransfromed.estimate and untransformed.asvar
       information and transformed asvar) by a "trafo" function; see ?trafoEst

 * ESTIMATION
   + minor correction sqrt((n-1)/n)*sd(x)
   + enhanced Covariance calculation for CvMDist-MDE
   + modified output in show - Confint-class


 * PLOTTING
   + fixed issue with cex.inner
   + fixed bug in plot-methods for argument "inner" under use of to.draw.arg argument
   + realized suggestions by A. Unwin, Augsburg;
     plot for L2paramFamilies may be restricted to selected subplots;
   + L2ParamFamily plot in distrMod is now are as flexible as plot-methods in pkg distr
   + small changes in AllPlot.R in distrMod
   + plot-L2ParamFamily now also digests ... , in particular grid()
   + some fix in order to cover the case of argument panel.first=grid()
     in the ... argument (needs a delayed evaluation...)


  * BUGFIXES
    + some minor issues in L2GroupFamilies (if locscalename is missing)
    + fixed issue with MCE, MLE and MDE; these are also defined for ParamFamily class
      objects; so they need not have an Information slot
    + fixed a bug in L2GroupFamilies:
      it must be .getLogDeriv(centraldistribution) instead of .getLogDeriv(distribution)
    + a minor buglet object@trafo instead of trafo(object)

##############
v 2.0.3
##############
  
  * under the hood: 
     + enhanced plotting (correct dispatch; opening of new device is controlled
       by option("newDevice") )
     + after JMC's changes: gone through setIs relations to ensure 
       "correct" inheritance
  * moved license to LGPL-3
  * new plot()-methods capabilities comparable to those of plot()-methods
    in package distr(): 
     + plot-L2ParamFamily now also digests ... , in particular panel.first=grid()
  * corrected some buglets:
     + corrected small bug in SimpleL2ParamFamilies.R ...
     + corrected small bug in GumbelLocationFamily ...
     + small modifications to modifyModel.R 
       ... modification of model a crucial step ... find a better way to do this???
  * new show() for 'confint'
  * new 'confint' methods for robust confidence intervals 

##############
v 2.0 
##############

* start of the package
* includes Parametric Models (with corresponding S4 classes)
* parameter (realized as corresponding S4 class) is split up into  
    +main part
    +nuisance part
    +fixed part
  may be transformed by user defined trafo function
* includes Minimum Criterium Estimators (with corresponding S4 classes)
   ---with particular cases 
   +Maximum Likelihood
   +Minimum Distance Estimators for 
    Kolmogorov, Hellinger, Totalvariation, and Cramer von Mises distance
* Minimum Criterum Estimators can (but do not need to) use method dispatch;
  this way particular methods beyond numerical optimization can be used
  without changing distrMod code
* has Symmetry classes (useful for avoiding unnecessary integrations)
* has biastype classes
* has norm classes (to be used for differently standardized risks and ICs)
* includes confint() methods for our Estimator classes
* features risk classes (mainly used in RobASt packages, though)
* includes demos/scripts
