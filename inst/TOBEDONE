+ improve Routines for asymptotic covariance / IC for MDE

+ model diagnostics:
   *several distances fitted-distribution
   *fitted density vs histogram
   *fitted cdf vs ecdf

+ generic treatment of data import by some generic 
  "prepare" function which does
   * cleaning from missings
   * coerce to standard data format

+ control class for controlling the optimizer

+ model classes for multivariate location and scale based on distrEllipse

+ generic functions to quantify model fit quality like AIC, BIC

+ enhance class ParamFamParameter by some slot metric for the 
  parameter space -> to be used for clipping with non-standard norms
